# Emails

I set up the contact form to send emails from the seandonnelly.co.uk domain name. This required setting up an SMTP service. On Heroku's marketplace, I chose Mailer To Go: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/mailertogo. It costs $9 per month (or $0.012 per hour - you are charged for all of the hours that the service is live but, I believe, you can pause/turn it off at any time to save money e.g. during development).
