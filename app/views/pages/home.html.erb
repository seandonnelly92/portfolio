    <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio.</p>
    <p>I've been building B2B and B2C tech products as a non-technical startup founder for over 5 years. Now, I'm focused on Software Engineering after completing an intensive coding bootcamp.</p>
    <p>I have led Product, UX, User Research, Sales, Marketing, Fundraising, Management and Compliance. So, it's fair to say I'm exceptionally adaptable and resilient. I'm a proactive problem-solver and I enjoy big challenges.</p>
    <p>If you're working on something exciting, <a href="/#contact">let's chat</a>!</p>
    <p>Cheers,<br>
      Sean</p>
